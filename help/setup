Setup

If there is a file `~/.haskeline`, then some settings for the Haskell
Readline implementation may be set, spanning all programs that use
Haskeline.  See [1] for more information.

If there is a directory `~/.lambda`, then a history of recent entries
will be stored there, as controled by the Haskeline library.
